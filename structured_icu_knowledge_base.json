The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.1 The most reliable evidence, and thus the best evidence for guiding clinical practice will generally come from adequately powered and properly conducted ran\u00ad domised clinical trials . It is commonly the case, however, that there are no individual RCTs that ade\u00ad quately address a particular question, and so clinicians may have to assess the ability of other studies such as cohort studies, case\u2013control studies and systematic reviews to supplement their clinical expertise."

The definition of lactic acidosis varies in the literature, although conventionally it is defined as the combination of a blood lactate concentra\u00ad tion greater than 5 mmol/L and an arterial blood pH of less than 7.35.1,2 It has been recognised, however, that the presence of hypoalbuminaemia may mask an anion gap and further that concomitant metabolic or respira\u00ad tory alkalosis may raise the pH. Lactic acidosis is caused by overproduction of lactate, decreased lactate metabo\u00ad lism, or a combination of the two. Lactic acidosis in critically ill patients is associated with a high mortality rate,3 as high as 83%.1 Lactic aci\u00ad dosis has been associated with higher mortality than other types of acidosis,3 and increasing blood lactate concentrations have been shown to be associated with increased mortality.1,4,5 In over 1000 patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of infection an initial lactate of \u22654 mmol/L was associated with sixfold higher odds of acute-phase death, and acute-phase and in-hospital deaths increased linearly with lactate.4 However, in 126 patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, lactic acidosis but not hyperlactaemia alone was found to predict in-hospital mortality more exactly.6 Lactate clearance is also associated with mortality."

This has been described in the pediat\u00ad ric literature, related to parents of intensive care patients.47 Though data in adult ICU populations are lacking, we believe that posttraumatic growth and resilience can be fostered through the implementation of a longitudinal care delivery pathway that spans the ICU to outpatient practice and is designed to mitigate PICS and educate, empower, and support the patient and family through recovery."

It is also essential that effective communication channels exist, allowing clear actionable messages to be communicated and responded to, quickly and appropri- ately. Finally, the key to success seems to be in the preparation that the organization should undertake to build systems and processes in absence of crises, which places it in a better position to overcome them."

So far, in the Netherlands only few infections with VRE have been documented, the incidence of infections with enterococci is low anyhow, it is unknown whether infections with VRE have an attributable mortality as compared to infections with vancomycin- susceptible enterococci, and the pharmaceutical industry will probably develop new and active antibiotics before severe clinical problems emerge. Moreover, the ban of avoparcine use in the veterinary industry has already resulted in a decrease of VRE-colonization in the community, suggesting that this problem will disappear spontaneously."

Providing the oxygen and removing the carbon dioxide is the responsibility of the lungs, and this chapter describes how the lungs perform this task, and how abnormalities in lung function can lead to deficits in arterial oxy- genation and accumulation of carbon dioxide ."

Introduction Prone positioning refers to mechanical ventilation with patients positioned in prone position in contrast of standard supine position. The use of the prone positioning was pro- posed over 30 years ago as a means to improve arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome \u200c. Since then, extensive physiological research has been conducted to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the observed improvement in gas exchange, which involve changes in the distribution of both ven- tilation and pulmonary blood flow."
